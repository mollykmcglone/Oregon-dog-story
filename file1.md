# A state dog for Oregon? Newfoundland suggested for the job

_By  Laura Frazier_ **| The Oregonian/OregonLive**
  
An Oregon House of Representatives committee will hear a pitch Thursday on naming the Newfoundland State Dog of Oregon. 

Becky Davis, who runs Notta Bear Newfoundlands kennel in Hubbard, is proposing the large waterdogs get the job. Davis' Newfoundlands visit nursing homes, treatment centers and hospitals as therapy animals and also participate in dog shows. 

The Newfoundland is a clear winner for Oregon due to its history in the state, Davis said. Explorer Meriwether Lewis brought his Newfoundland, Seaman, along on his expedition to Oregon territory with William Clark in the early 1800s.

Newfoundlands, with their webbed feet and thick water-repellant coats, are also known for water rescue, fitting with Oregon's collection of waterways, Davis said. Full-grown males can weigh between 150 and 170 pounds, she added, but the dogs typically have a sweet and calm disposition. 

"They're non-aggressive and love their families," Davis said. "They're just natural service dogs." 

Only some states currently have official dog breeds. In Alaska, the state dog is the Alaskan Malamute. Maryland has the Chesapeake Bay Retriever. 

Thursday's presentation to the House Interim Committee on Rules will be a first step toward considering a state dog for Oregon, Davis said. She plans to attend with her family and two of her Newfoundlands, four-year-old Shadrach and five-month-old Olga. 

"I would love to see them put in place," Davis said. "When you start giving a state something of interest, the public (wants) to come see."
